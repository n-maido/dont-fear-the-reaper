# Inspiration

This project is based on the simple concept of Hide & Seek and the theme is inspired by the song "Don't Fear the Reaper!"


# What it does

This game allows users to play a basic Hide & Seek game from two opposing perspectives :


# Perspective 1 - The Reaper :

You are a diligent worker, just trying to do your job and get through your list of To Kills. All you need to do is chase after the TBD and harvest their soul.


# Perspective 2 - TBD (To Be Deceased) :

You are a diligent worker, on your way to your job at the market. But something seems to be chasing you, something scary ...and you are not ready to go just yet.

# General rules:

    As the Reaper, you need to catch the TBD as fast as possible
    As the TBD you need to find the exit to the maze in the shortest possible time.
    for each millisecond you are in the game you get 10 points. In both perspectives, the lower the score, the better

# How we built it

    We used the Godot game engine to build the multiple screens and transitions between them.
