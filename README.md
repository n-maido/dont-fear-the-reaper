# Don't Fear the Reaper!
A 2D hide 'n' seek game.

## Concept
Based on a simple hide and seek concept, you can choose to play as 2 different characters, each one having opposite perspectives.

### Perspective 1: The Grim Reaper
You are a diligent worker, just trying to do your job. The goal is to chase after the TBD and harvest their soul.

### Perspective 2: Character TBD (To Be Deceased)
You're not ready to go just yet. The creature chasing after you looks kinda scary. The goal is to evade and find the exit portal.
